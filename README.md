## C++ Project :trollface:
My first ever C++ programming project during my 1st year of study :wink:.  

This project mainly testing my understanding and hands-on skill on object class usage in C++.

It is a flight order system which system admin can manage the flight schedule, foods, drink and passenger.

At that time i'm still new to programming, so i used text file as my database in this project instead of SQL :sweat:.

It was in **console mode** only. 

## System funtion
  * Admin login
  * Check passenger status
  * Add & edit flight table
  * Add & edit food/drink list
